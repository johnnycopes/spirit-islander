This is a setup generator for the board game [Spirit Island](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island) by R. Eric Reuss. Spirit Island is a modular game with many different configurations that add interesting variety and challenge. This tool removes the burden of having to calculate these configurations manually by instantaneously generating randomized game setups that adhere to the player's prefences.

Spirit Islander is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

#### Future Improvements

1. Enable shift + click usage to select/deselect a range of checkboxes at once
1. A "Play" feature accessible from the Game Setup screen that has a victory/defeat calculator so that the player can tally their final game score

#### Goals of this project:

- Build an app with a significant amount of user interaction
- Improve Svelte skills further by building a complex form
- Make a useful yet simple tool that works well on desktop and mobile

#### Local installation:

To run this locally on your machine, clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:

```

```
